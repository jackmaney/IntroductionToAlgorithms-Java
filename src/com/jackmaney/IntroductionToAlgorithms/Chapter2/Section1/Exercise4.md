Exercise 2.1-4
--------------

The code for representing an integer in `n` bits via two's complement* can be found in `BinaryInteger.java` within the namespace `com.jackmaney.IntroductionToAlgorithms.Chapter2.Section1`. There are also jUnit tests within the same namespace within the `test` folder.



**Input:** Two integers `A` and `B` represented as arrays of zeroes and ones via two's complement.

**Output:** An integer `C` represented as an array of zeroes and ones via two's complement that equals the sum of `A` and `B`.


*- Yes, I know that the problem technically wants the overflow bit. I decided to switch the implementation slightly.
