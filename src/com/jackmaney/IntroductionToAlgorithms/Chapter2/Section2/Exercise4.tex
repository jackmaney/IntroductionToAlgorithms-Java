How can we modify almost any algorithm to have a good best-case running time?

Well, if it's easy to find out if the input is a best-case input (e.g. a list of already sorted items for a sorting algorithm) such that there's a simple answer to give for said best-case input (e.g. outputting the input for a best-case input to a sorting algorithm), then this modification can be made fairly easily.
